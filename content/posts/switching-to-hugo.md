I have decided to build my blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), instead of Wordpress, which I am currently using. There are several reasons for this, but mainly:
1. I get more control over the site.
2. It can be hosted with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com).
3. It allows for much simpler (and smaller) sites.

This means that until I get busk.blog changed, my blog will be available at https://builditbusk.github.io/blog.

## What is Hugo?
Hugo is a static site generator. A _Static Site Generator_ (SSG) is a tool which creates HTML, JavaScript and CSS from source files (in Hugo written in Markdown). It also allows themes, which makes it easy to create a decent looking site, even if you - like me - has no talent for UI design.

## What's wrong with Wordpress?
To be clear, I was using Wordpress.com, the _Content Management System_ (CMS). This meant that all my posts were stored online only, with the possibility (although unlikely) that Wordpress could remove them at any given time. Using Hugo (or any other SSG) will allow me to have everything locally, as well as in a Git repository. So no single dependency.

Also Wordpress (the CMS version) costs money. That's totally fair, but for me the cost-benefit ratio just wasn't good enough. Switching to Hugo allows more ways to host the site. I've chosen Github pages for now, but I have the option to change it later, if I want.

## What about all your previous post?
I haven't decided yet. I think I will go over them and transfer the relevant ones to the new site. If there are some popular old ones, which are a bit dated (I have one on unit testing with Entity Framework) I may update them and put them on the new site as well.
